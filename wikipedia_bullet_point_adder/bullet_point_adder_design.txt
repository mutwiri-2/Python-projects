Project: Adding Bullets to Wiki Markup Design problem statement

When editing a Wikipedia article, you can create a bulleted list by putting each
list item on its own line and placing a star in front. But say you have a really
large list that you want to add bullet points to. Design a short Python script
that takes a list and places a star in front of every list item

Design
1. Get text from clipboard - user copies the list and you get that text copied
from the clipboard 
2. Add a star and space to the beginning of each line in the text copied from
clipboard
3. paste the new text to the clipboard
